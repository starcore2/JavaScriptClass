//Guess that pokemon
//First we need to pick a random pokemon
//We need to have information requests
//A basic html to display what is known
//reset button to pick a new pokemon
//differnt types of input to see what you want to know.
/*
    The core idea of differnt inputs is we can ask questions, the less questions asked, the better your score will be.
    What questions to ask is
    What is one of it's stats (attack, defence, special, etc.)
    What is one of it's abilties can it have? counts as two questions 
    What item does it tend to hold
    What is a move does it know? counts as three questions
    How many moves can it know? move pool quanty?
    Does it have one or two types? 
    What type is it? counts as 3 questions
    Each failed guess will count as a question.
